### Overview
For customers lacking Disaster Recovery (DR) expertise or that are short of staff to maintain a DR solution, Disaster Recovery Management Service (DRMS) takes the responsibilities and delivers end-to-end services. Unlike other DRaaS solutions, CenturyLink DRMS carries out regular audits, tests, and at-time-of-disaster (ATOD) failover services to ensure the reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of your DR solution. DRMS offers services including:

* White-glove on boarding
* 24 X 7 monitoring and maintenance
* Semi-annual testing
* Quarterly audits
* ATOD failover services
* Failback services
* Runbook automation and maintenance
* Application recovery services
